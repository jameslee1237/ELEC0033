HERO 

Introduction:
This application is a part of the HERO system, which is an IoT solution for gathering and analyzing foot-traffic data in a supermarket. The application generates a real-time heatmap based on the data collected from various sensors and devices installed in the supermarket. The heatmap provides insights on the level of foot-traffic in different areas of the supermarket, which can be utilized by the customers and supermarket owners for various purposes.

Getting Started:
To use this application, you need the remaining components of the HERO system, which is the Arduino, sensors and Arduino code. If they are present, download the repository, run the Arduino code first, then run the app.py file. Once the file is running, type in localhost:5000 or 127.0.0.1:5000 on your web browser to access the web application.

Usage:
The application uses the data collected from the sensors and devices to generate a heatmap, which is displayed in real-time. The heatmap indicates the level of foot-traffic in different areas of the supermarket, with the areas having high traffic being represented by warmer colors. The processed data can be utilized in various ways, such as comparing with sales figures to identify effective placement strategies, ensuring availability of trolleys during high-traffic times, and providing data analytics using artificial intelligence and machine learning technology for useful insights.
